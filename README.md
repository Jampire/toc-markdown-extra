# TOC Markdown Extra

This package adds Table of Contents capability (TOC) to 
[PHP Markdown Extra](https://michelf.ca/projects/php-markdown/) package.  

TOC functionality is ported from [Sculpin](https://sculpin.io/) project. Sculpin is 
[Static Site Generator](https://www.staticgen.com/about) written in PHP and based on [Symfony](https://symfony.com/).

## Installation

To install, use composer:

```
composer require jampire/toc-markdown-extra
``` 

## Usage

Please, see PHP Markdown Extra [documentation](https://github.com/michelf/php-markdown).

You can use [PhpStorm IDE](https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/) with Markdown (bundled) plugin to automatically 
generate TOC as PhpStorm uses the same algorithm for 'id' generation.
